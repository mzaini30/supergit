# SuperGit

Running git push to multiple repositories automatically.

## Install

```bash
npm i -g supergit
```

## Commands

`s` command to run `git status`

`c` command to run `git commit`

`p` command to run `git push`

## How is it different from normal Git?

So, we can run `c` command in any repository. Then, by typing the command `p`, it will automatically run `git push` on all the committed repositories.
